angle_style command :h3

[Syntax:]

angle_style style :pre

style = {none} or {hybrid} or {charmm} or {class2} or {cosine} or \
        {cosine/squared} or {harmonic} :ul

[Examples:]

angle_style harmonic
angle_style charmm
angle_style hybrid harmonic cosine :pre

[Description:]

Set the formula(s) LAMMPS uses to compute angle interactions between
triplets of atoms, which remain in force for the duration of the
simulation.  The list of angle triplets is read in by a
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html command
from a data or restart file.

Hybrid models where angles are computed using different angle
potentials can be setup using the {hybrid} angle style.

The coefficients associated with a angle style can be specified in a
data or restart file or via the "angle_coeff"_angle_coeff.html command.

All angle potentials store their coefficient data in binary restart
files which means angle_style and "angle_coeff"_angle_coeff.html
commands do not need to be re-specified in an input script that
restarts a simulation.  See the "read_restart"_read_restart.html
command for details on how to do this.  The one exception is that
angle_style {hybrid} only stores the list of sub-styles in the restart
file; angle coefficients need to be re-specified.

NOTE: When both an angle and pair style is defined, the
"special_bonds"_special_bonds.html command often needs to be used to
turn off (or weight) the pairwise interaction that would otherwise
exist between 3 bonded atoms.

In the formulas listed for each angle style, {theta} is the angle
between the 3 atoms in the angle.

Here is an alphabetic list of angle styles defined in LAMMPS.  Click on
the style to display the formula it computes and coefficients
specified by the associated "angle_coeff"_angle_coeff.html command.

Click on the style to display the formula it computes, any additional
arguments specified in the angle_style command, and coefficients
specified by the associated "angle_coeff"_angle_coeff.html command.

There are also additional accelerated pair styles included in the
LAMMPS distribution for faster performance on CPUs, GPUs, and KNLs.
The individual style names on the "Commands
angle"_Commands_bond.html#angle doc page are followed by one or more
of (g,i,k,o,t) to indicate which accelerated styles exist.

[Restrictions:]

Angle styles can only be set for atom_styles that allow angles to be
defined.

Most angle styles are part of the MOLECULE package.  They are only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.  The doc pages for
individual bond potentials tell if it is part of a package.
