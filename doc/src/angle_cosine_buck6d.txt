angle_style cosine/buck6d command :h3

[Syntax:]

angle_style cosine/buck6d :pre

[Examples:]

angle_style cosine/buck6d
angle_coeff 1  cosine/buck6d  1.978350  4  180.000000 :pre

[Description:]

The {cosine/buck6d} angle style uses the potential

:c,image(Eqs/angle_cosine_buck6d.jpg)

where K is the energy constant, n is the periodic multiplicity and
Theta0 is the equilibrium angle.

The coefficients must be defined for each angle type via the
"angle_coeff"_angle_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands in the following order:

K (energy)
n
Theta0 (degrees) :ul

Theta0 is specified in degrees, but LAMMPS converts it to radians
internally.

Additional to the cosine term the {cosine/buck6d} angle style computes
the short range (vdW) interaction belonging to the
"pair_buck6d"_pair_buck6d_coul_gauss.html between the end atoms of the
angle.  For this reason this angle style only works in combination
with the "pair_buck6d"_pair_buck6d_coul_gauss.html styles and needs
the "special_bonds"_special_bonds.html 1-3 interactions to be weighted
0.0 to prevent double counting.

[Restrictions:]

{cosine/buck6d} can only be used in combination with the
"pair_buck6d"_pair_buck6d_coul_gauss.html style and with a
"special_bonds"_special_bonds.html 0.0 weighting of 1-3 interactions.

This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
USER-MOFFF package.  See the "Build package"_Build_package.html doc
page for more info.
