Download an executable for Mac :h3

LAMMPS can be downloaded, built, and configured for OS X on a Mac with
"Homebrew"_homebrew.  The following LAMMPS packages are unavailable at this
time because of additional needs not yet met: GPU, KOKKOS, LATTE, MSCG,
MESSAGE, MPIIO POEMS VORONOI.

After installing Homebrew, you can install LAMMPS on your system with
the following commands:

% brew install lammps :pre

This will install the executables "lammps_serial" and "lammps_mpi", as well as
the LAMMPS "doc", "potentials", "tools", "bench", and "examples" directories.

Once LAMMPS is installed, you can test the installation with the
Lennard-Jones benchmark file:

% brew test lammps -v :pre

The LAMMPS binary is built with the "KIM package"_Build_extras#kim which
results in Homebrew also installing the `kim-api` binaries when LAMMPS is
installed.  In order to use potentials from "openkim.org"_openkim, you can
install the `openkim-models` package

% brew install openkim-models :pre

If you have problems with the installation you can post issues to
"this link"_homebrew.

Thanks to Derek Thomas (derekt at cello.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp) for setting
up the Homebrew capability.
