Install LAMMPS :h2

You can download LAMMPS as an executable or as source code.

With source code, you also have to "build LAMMPS"_Build.html.  But you
have more flexibility as to what features to include or exclude in the
build.  If you plan to "modify or extend LAMMPS"_Modify.html, then you
need the source code.

These are the files and sub-directories in the LAMMPS distribution:

README: text file
LICENSE: GNU General Public License (GPL)
bench: benchmark problems
cmake: CMake build files
doc: documentation
examples: simple test problems
lib: additional provided or external libraries
potentials: interatomic potential files
python: Python wrapper on LAMMPS
src: source files

You will have all of these if you download source.  You will only have
some of them if you download executables, as explained on the pages
listed above.
