angle_style dipole command :h3
angle_style dipole/omp command :h3

[Syntax:]

angle_style dipole :pre

[Examples:]

angle_style dipole
angle_coeff 6 2.1 180.0 :pre

[Description:]

The {dipole} angle style is used to control the orientation of a dipolar
atom within a molecule "(Orsi)"_#Orsi. Specifically, the {dipole} angle
style restrains the orientation of a point dipole mu_j (embedded in atom
'j') with respect to a reference (bond) vector r_ij = r_i - r_j, where 'i'
is another atom of the same molecule (typically, 'i' and 'j' are also
covalently bonded).

It is convenient to define an angle gamma between the 'free' vector mu_j
and the reference (bond) vector r_ij:

:c,image(Eqs/angle_dipole_gamma.jpg)

The {dipole} angle style uses the potential:

:c,image(Eqs/angle_dipole_potential.jpg)

where K is a rigidity constant and gamma0 is an equilibrium (reference)
angle.

The torque on the dipole can be obtained by differentiating the
potential using the 'chain rule' as in appendix C.3 of
"(Allen)"_#Allen1:

:c,image(Eqs/angle_dipole_torque.jpg)

Example: if gamma0 is set to 0 degrees, the torque generated by
the potential will tend to align the dipole along the reference
direction defined by the (bond) vector r_ij (in other words, mu_j is
restrained to point towards atom 'i').

The dipolar torque T_j must be counterbalanced in order to conserve
the local angular momentum. This is achieved via an additional force
couple generating a torque equivalent to the opposite of T_j:

:c,image(Eqs/angle_dipole_couple.jpg)

where F_i and F_j are applied on atoms i and j, respectively.

The following coefficients must be defined for each angle type via the
"angle_coeff"_angle_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

K (energy)
gamma0 (degrees) :ul

Styles with a {gpu}, {intel}, {kk}, {omp}, or {opt} suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed on the "Speed packages"_Speed_packages.html doc
page.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the GPU, USER-INTEL, KOKKOS,
USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the "-suffix command-line
switch"_Run_options.html when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can use the
"suffix"_suffix.html command in your input script.

See the "Speed packages"_Speed_packages.html doc page for more
instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

[Restrictions:]

This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
USER-MISC package.  See the "Build package"_Build_package.html doc
page for more info.

NOTE: In the "Angles" section of the data file, the atom ID 'j'
defining the direction of the dipole vector to restrain must come
before the atom ID of the reference atom 'i'. A third atom ID 'k' must
also be provided to comply with the requirement of a valid angle
definition. This atom ID k should be chosen to be that of an atom
bonded to atom 'i' to avoid errors with "lost angle atoms" when running
in parallel. Since the LAMMPS code checks for valid angle definitions,
cannot use the same atom ID of either 'i' or 'j' (this was allowed
and recommended with older LAMMPS versions).

The "newton" command for intramolecular interactions must be "on"
(which is the default except when using some accelerator packages).

This angle style should not be used with SHAKE.
