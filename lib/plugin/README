This directory has a Makefile.lammps file with settings that allows
LAMMPS to dynamically link LAMMPS plugins. More details about this
are in the manual.

In order to be able to dynamically load and execute the plugins from
inside LAMMPS, you need to link with a system library containing functions
like dlopen(), dlsym() and so on for dynamic linking of executable code
into an executable.  This library is defined by setting the plugin_SYSLIB
variable in the Makefile.lammps file in this dir.  For this mechanism
to work, LAMMPS must be built as a shared library (i.e. with mode=shared).

For Linux and most current unix-like operating systems, this can be
kept at the default setting of "-ldl" (on some platforms this library
is called "-ldld").  The Windows platform is currently not supported.

See the header of Makefile.lammps for more info.
