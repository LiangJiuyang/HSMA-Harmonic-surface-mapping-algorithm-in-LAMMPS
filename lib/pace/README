This directory contains files required to use the USER-PACE package,
which provides the pace pair style, an efficient implementation of 
the Atomic Cluster Expansion potential (ACE).
ACE is a methodology for deriving a highly accurate classical potential
fit to a large archive of quantum mechanical (DFT) data. 
This package was written by Yury Lysogorskiy and others
at ICAMS, the Interdisciplinary Centre for Advanced Materials Simulation, 
Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, http://www.icams.de

You can type "make lib-pace" from the src directory to see help on
how to download and build this library via make commands, or you can
do the same thing by typing "python Install.py" from within this
directory.

More information about the USER-PACE implementation of ACE 
is available here:
